## package.json

Not straightforward to answer, but "basically":

<v-clicks>

- `exports` only if you want to be future-facing, and only future-facing
- `main`, `module`, and `exports` if you want (or need to) be compatible with most setup

## What are Nuxt Modules?

Nuxt Modules are registered inside your Nuxt config file:

```typescript {all|5|6|1,7|8-11|5,14}
import thirdModule from "third-module"

export default defineNuxtConfig({
	modules: [
		"@vite-pwa/nuxt",
		"~/modules/my-module",
		thirdModule,
		[
			"@nuxtjs/prismic",
			{ endpoint: "example" }
		],
	],

	pwa: { writePlugin: false }
})
```
